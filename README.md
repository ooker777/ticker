This is a modification from [Rustingsword's script](https://gist.github.com/RustingSword/4368301) to emphasize the most important thing: the actual productivity time. The differences are:

- English display
- Only categorize the activities as Focused and Non-Focused. In the script, I term it as Dispassionated Concentration, because you have to feel dispassionate (or [detachment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detachment_(philosophy))) about your [mental monkey](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arj7oStGLkU) in order to stop the procrastination. It is a Buddhism perspective, and related to [mindfulness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mindfulness).
- The focused time is large and emboldened. 
- Activation switches to NumLock

To-do: 
[ ] Time spent from last idle
[ ] Time spent on non-focused activities from last idle
[ ] Time shift

Apparently today I have spent 4 hours to write this script but only 45 minutes to read textbook. I hope once it's done this chronic situation can be reversed.
